## Research Project

I'm interested in exploring ex parte submissions on the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) website.

The FCC [defines](https://www.fcc.gov/proceedings-actions/ex-parte) an ex parte presentation as: 

> "a communication, written or oral, directed to the merits or outcome of a proceeding that, if written, is not served on all the parties to a proceeding, and if oral, is made without giving all the parties to the proceeding advance notice and an opportunity for them to be present."

In other words, it's a chance for parties to an FCC proceeding to lobby their case to the FCC directly, outside the regular world of submitting written comments and giving all other parties the chance to reply to those comments. 

For many case proceedings, where the FCC is trying to determine which action to take on a policy matter, it may be advantageous for parties to speak directly to the commissioners in charge of making a decision, in order to make their case without interruption or objections from opposing sides. It doesn't sound fair, but in theory, if _every_ party was given the same opportunities to make their case directly with commissioners, it would be equitable. 

I aim to find out if that's what actually happens, or if only a select few get to bypass the regular comment rodeo to advocate for certain things in private. In other words, I aim to answer the question: **who has the FCC's ear?**

### Net Neutrality

In order to investigate ex parte communications, I'm going to focus on one specific FCC docket: the [Restoring Internet Freedom docket](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?proceedings_name=17-108&sort=date_disseminated,DESC), known more broadly as the Net Neutrality case. Under the leadership of Ajit Pai, the FCC effectively voted to repeal net neutrality in the US on December 14, 2017.

Multiple parties submitted ex parte disclosures as required by the law. Ex parte disclosures are filed separately in the FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS), making them easy to flag and separate.

[This is an example of what an ex parte disclosure looks like](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10272971228987/Akamai%20ex%20parte%2010.25.17.pdf)

I aim to analyze these disclosures to differentiate between the different types of ex partes that occurred in the net neutrality docket. Ex partes can include any number of communications with FCC officials, from in-person meetings to written letters sent to commissioners. I want to categorize the type of ex parte communication, as well as the originator, in order to measure whether one specific party, or type of party (such as industry, as opposed to consumer advocacy groups, or government agencies), got more or better access to the Commission as they made their decisions.
