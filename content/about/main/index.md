  I'm originally from Argentina, but I've been calling Massachusetts my home for over a decade. I'm doing the MS degree part-time while working full time in broadband policy (and more!) for the Commonwealth.
  
  This is my first time attempting to deploy a Hugo blog (or really any blog) via Github and Netlify. If you're reading this, hopefully that means I didn't mess it up 100%.
